This file contains a list of to-dos and suggestions for the future of this project, for each file.

GENERAL:
- run Crocus/... and force it to get a final microstructure that matches the one on NIR images for confirmation
- wind erosions stop when they reach a harder layer > this could give us information of where hard layers are
- discretize NIR images into gray values, define layers at the points of the simulated snowpits, plot both simulated and discretized NIR together for comparison
- do this also for the 2021 data that is more contrasted
- test the climate model hypothesis: is an 'average point' really representative of the average of points?
- juxtapose lidar curves from neighbouring points to see if abrupt/strange events are signal or noise
- add Fortran subroutines from latest version (GET_THERMAL_CONDUCTIVITY, GET_GRAIN_SIZE_SNTHERM) > convert to Fortran 95 and compile with f2py

little_awk_functions:
- the new version of snowpack_evolution (df, taking the meteorological input data as a dataframe) is much slower than the previous one > fix that, make it linear using pandas?

01-Filling_time_gaps.ipynb:
- make a function of the whole process

12-Sensitivity_tests.ipynb:
- look at more decimals to discriminate p-correl/rmse in the sensitivity analysis

14-Validation.ipynb:
- interpolate temperature values
- make statistics from several points

23-Artificial_snowpit_figure.ipynb:
- figure out why if y_min=y_max all values are nan in data_set_used
- get all figures with the same colorbar values (?)
- add ticks on the colorbars to be able to read the layers' ages directly
- in creation of dataset to store the outputs: convert the time into pd.datetime directly. add units to parameters and data.
- take a slice of the snowpack that is parallel to the wind direction for more intuitiveness
